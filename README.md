# Client-Server

 I have developed a code for simple Client Server chat.This chat service allows you to send and receive messages. 
 Its using Tkinter and Sqlite3 for database connectivity. 
Common Steps:
1.	Check those python3 and tkinter libraries are installed in your PC.
2.	Clone or download this repository.
3.	Enter into the sign in and login folder through terminal or powershell using cd command
